# UBC Grade Tool
A web tool built to help UBC students compare courses based on the past averages over a 5-year interval
The search tool is based on Campus, Year Level, Subject Code and a minimum average you set as a filter
All courses that meet the minimum average and other criteria mentioned above will be displayed

# What did I learn?
* I learned how to write asynchronous code to access and display the relevant data from UBC's Historical Grade API
* I revisited effective sorting algorithms and implemented my version of quicksort to display courses by percentage in descending order
* I learned how to use handlebars to create a multi-selection menu of relevant search criteria
